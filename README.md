# ntu-course-planning-system
This project initiated by me and Taoyu Chen aims to provide NTU students with a website where they could plan their courses in the most convenient manner. It automatically generates possible index combinations of the input courses without any clash.

The server is written in Python and Django while the data are stored in MySQL.
